# Research and Innovation Exercise

- Do research on React Redux and JWT(JSON Web Token) concepts.
- Create a small application to demonstrate the concepts.

1) Redux is an open-source JavaScript library. Redux is being used for building the user interface.
2) JSON Web Token is an open industry standard used to share information between two entities, usually a client (like your app's frontend) and a server (your app's backend). JWT is mostly used for authorization and information exchange.
